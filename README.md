# decomlib
decomlib is a high-performance toolkit for matrix and tensor decompositions, designed to let you compute full or truncated factorizations on dense, sparse or implicitly-defined operators. It supports modern hardware — CPUs and GPUs (Intel, AMD, NVIDIA) — and lets you specify algorithmic paths (randomized, Krylov/subspace, structure-aware) or rely on automatic selection. Built on a Fortran kernel with a Python front-end, decomlib makes it easy to plug in new decompositions (e.g., SVD, CP, Tucker, NMF) over time, while giving you control over precision, error monitoring and execution backend.
